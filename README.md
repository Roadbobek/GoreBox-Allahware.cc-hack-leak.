Mod Installation Guide

Download BepInEx:

Go to the BepInEx bleeding edge builds page: https://builds.bepinex.dev/projects/bepinex_be

Look for the latest build of "BepInEx Unity (IL2CPP) for Windows (x64) games". Download the .zip file.

Extract BepInEx:

Locate your game's installation folder (where the game's .exe file is).

Extract the contents of the downloaded BepInEx .zip file directly into your game's installation folder. You should see new folders like BepInEx and doorstop_config.ini appear next to the game's .exe.

Install Your Mod DLL:

Inside the game's installation folder, navigate into the BepInEx folder, then into the plugins folder.

Place your compiled mod's .dll file (AllahWare - LEAKED BY ROADBOBEK.dll) into this plugins folder.

That's it! When you launch the game, BepInEx should load your mod automatically.
